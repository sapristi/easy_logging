{1 Easy logging }

   Logging library inspired by the Python logging module.

  Easy_logging allows fine-grained tuning of of when and where and how log messages are printed,
  with relatively low configuration, and simple logger configuration and usage.

It has the following features :
   - one line logger creation
   - log messages printf style, or provide [string] or [string lazy_t] message
   - loggers for tree architecture for easy level and handlers configuration
   - handlers associated to each logger will filter, format and treat the message independantly
   - use tags and tag generators to add contextual information to log messages
   - use default handlers for outputing log messages to stdout, stderr or to a file
   - declare your own handler for anything else

{4     Basic example } 
{[   
open Easy_logging
logger = Logging.make_logger "my_logger" (Some Debug) [Cli Debug]
logger#info "log_message" ]}   
will output to the stdout a message of the form
{v 1.306  my_logger    Info    log_message v}

{2:description Overall description }

The logging infrastructure is based on four concepts:
 
{e loggers,  handlers, log items } and {e logging tree}.

A call to {e logger} will create a {e log item}, which it will pass to its {e handlers}. Each {e handler} will treats the {e item} (e.g. transform it to a string, and then outputs to stdout or to a file).
{v
                                     ___________
                                    | handler 1 |
               _______________      |-----------|
              |     logger    | ==> |   ( * )   |
              |---------------|     |___________|
(message) ==> | -> log item   |      ___________
              [_______________| ==> | handler 2 |
                                    |   ...     |
v}

{3 Logging tree}

Loggers are stored in a tree structure, with the following properties :

 - messages handled by a logger (after level filtering) are passed to its ancestor's handlers (this can be overriden with the [set_propagate] method).
 - if not set, the level of a logger is that of its closest ancestor whose level is set (or NoLevel if there is no such ancestor)

{4 Example}
{v
                       A (Info, Cli Debug)
                     /    \
                  A.B      A.C
                 /            \
            A.B.D (Warning)    A.C.E (Debug, (File "f", Debug),
                                                propagate=false)
v}
For example, with the above logging tree
 - logs made to [A], [A.B] or [A.C] of level [Info] or more are written to the stdout.
 - logs made to [A.B.D] of level [Warning] or above are written the stdout.
 - logs made to [A.C.E] are only written to the file ["f"]

{3 Levels}

To each logger and log message are associated a level, which will
be used to filter the messages going through the logging infrastructure.

The predefined levels are, in increasing order of precedence :
 + Debug   : used for debugging.
 + Trace   : used between info and debug
 + Info    : used to trace program execution.
 + Warning : used for warnings.
 + Error   : used for errors.
 + Flash   : used for one-shot debugging: displays an easy to spot message.
 + NoLevel : used to filter out all messages.

{3 Log items }

A log item has type
{[
    type log_item = {
        level : level;          (* the level of the log item *)
        logger_name : string;   (* the name of the logger to which the log call was passed *)
        msg : string;           (* the actual log message *)
        tags : string list      (* a list of tags *)
      } ]}


{2:handlers Handlers}
Four handler creation helper function are provided. They  instantiate handlers with a level of their own to filter messages :
 - Cli handler: outputs colored messages to stdout.
   {[ let h = Handlers.make (Cli Debug) ]}
 - CliErr handler: outputs colored messages to stderr.
   {[ let h = Handlers.make (CliErr Debug) ]}
 - File handler : outputs messages to a given file.
   {[ let h = Handlers.make (File ("filename", Debug)) ]}
 - RotatingFile handler : outputs messages to a given file. Takes as argument the max number of kb per log file, and the number of backup log files.
   {[ let h = Handlers.make (RotatingFile ("filename", Debug, 65536, 3)) ]}

Log file creation is governed by configuration values (setting up file name prefix/suffix, folder, file creation mode, etc...). The configuration can be specified when creating the handlers explicitely (like above), and a default configuration can be set in the Logging module.

{2:logger Loggers}

See complete class documentation at {! Easy_logging.Logging.logger}

{3 Creation}

A logger object can be created directly (in which case it will not be part of the logging tree)
{[ let logger1 = new Logging.logger "my_logger1" ]}
or through helper functions of the {!logging} module.

{3 Usage}

A logger object has three methods for each of the log levels:

 - one that takes a formatting string and parameters (printf like)
  {[logger1#debug "Myvar : %s" (to_string myvar); ]}
 - one that takes a [string lazy_t]
  {[logger1#ldebug (lazy (heavy_calculation ())); ]}
 - one that takes a [string]
  {[ logger1#sdebug (to_string myvar);]}

{2:logging The Logging module}

The {! Easy_logging.Logging} module is the application of [MakeLogging] over [Handlers].
It provides two functions :

 - {[ val make_logger :
    ?propagate:bool -> string -> log_level -> Handlers.desc list ]}
    Instantiates a logger with some paramters, and adds it to the logging tree.

 - {[ val get_logger : string -> logger ]}
 Returns a registered logger, or creates a new one if it doesn't exist.

 - {[val set_handlers_config : Handlers.config -> unit]}
  Sets the default handlers configuration, used when creating new handlers via [make_logger].

{2:makelogging The MakeLogging functor }

The MakeLogging functor takes a {!Easy_logging__.Easy_logging_types.HandlersT} typed module, and creates a Logging module.

{3 WARNING}
When declaring your Handlers module, do not coerce it the type [HandlersT], because then  its internal types [t] and [desc] won't be accessible.
